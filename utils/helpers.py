    process the indentation levels to build nested LaTeX `itemize` or `enumerate` environments:
    check that the indentation is valid and replace absolute number of spaces by integers representing
    indentation levels

    process
    -------
    - represent the markdown list as a list of lists: `[markdown list item, its indentation level]`
    - check that the indentation is valid:
      - if all items are indented (no `^-`), then the shared leading spaces are removed
      - if the list items have different indentation levels, all indentation
        levels must be a multiple of the indentation of the 1st indented item
        (e.g., if the first indentation is 2, then all items must be indented by n*2 spaces
    - replace absolute number of spaces by indentation levels.
      - an item can only gain one indentation level at a time.
        if an item jumps indentation level, reset the indentation level: prev = n, new = n+1.
        (e.g.:
         - indentation multiplier = 2
         - previous item: indentation level = 2 => its absolute nesting level `n` is 1
         - current item: indentation level = 6
           => theoritically, its nesting level should be 3, but that doesn't make
              sense and doesn't work in markdown => we reset it to 2.)
      - in short: if n[current] - n[prev] > 1, then n[current] is redifined as n[prev] += 1
        (with n[current] the current indentation level and n[prev] the previous one
