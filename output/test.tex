Lumpy Space Princess 
\begin{figure}

\end{figure} (possibly known as Lumpy Space Queen and often 
referred ``to `by her' initials", LSP) is the queen of Lumpy Space. She is one 
of the three most recurring princesses, the other two being Flame Princess 
and Princess Bubblegum. Finn and Jake have traveled to Lumpy Space as well 
as to her parents' residence after she accidentally bit Jake in "Trouble 
in Lumpy Space``. According to the events in "Princess Day," she is not 
recognized by the chair of princesses, partially because of her dramatic 
attitude and the fact that she is no longer the heir to Lumpy Space. 


Since the episode ``To Cut a Woman's Hair," Lumpy Space Princess lived on 
her own in the woods of Ooo. According to her story in ``The Monster," she 
lived among wolves, was banished, and began terrorizing a small village in 
order to eat their crops. She had returned to Lumpy Space, but as of 
``Princess Monster Wife," she decided to go back to living on her own in the 
woods as a hobo, presumably going back home every now and again to visit 
her parents.

It is revealed in ``Skyhooks II" that Lumpy Space Princess is the most powerful of the Elementals, a group of beings who embody the cosmic forces that make up Ooo. <br As the Elemental of Lumps, she can negate the powers of other Elementals and reverse the damage they cause, should they ever go rogue.
